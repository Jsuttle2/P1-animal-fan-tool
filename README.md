# Animal Fan Tool

## Description

This is an HTML and JavaScript code that creates an animal fan tool. It provides a user interface with a selection menu of different animals, and upon selecting an animal name from the dropdown, the tool uses API calls to populate a video or gif for that animal. There are three dropdown menus in total - one for videos, one for gifs, and one for wikipedia articles (coming soon!).

## Getting started

The tool relies on third-party APIs for its functionality. In the current implementation, it uses the YouTube API to retrieve video content, and the Giphy API to retrieve gif content. The URLs for these APIs are hardcoded into the JavaScript file as youtubeUrl and giphyUrl. Make sure that these URLs are still valid and active before attempting to run the code.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply open this link in your browser of choice!

You will be presented with three dropdown menus - one for videos, one for gifs, and one for wikipedia articles (coming soon!). Select an animal name from the dropdown, and the tool will use the relevant API to populate a video or gif for that animal.
